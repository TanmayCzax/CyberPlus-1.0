# Cyber+   
**An Ethical Cyber Security Programming Language**

Cyber+ is a domain‑specific programming language (DSL) designed for **ethical hacking, cybersecurity learning, and security automation**.  
It allows users to perform reconnaissance, OSINT, security analysis, and simulations using **simple, readable scripts** (`.cbp` files).

>  Cyber+ is built strictly for **ethical, educational, and defensive security purposes only**.
